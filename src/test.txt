### 📩 Subject: My Leadership Approach and Plan to Empower the Team

Dear \[Manager's Name] / Team,

As I step into the role of **Team Lead**, I want to share my approach and guiding principles to foster an environment where we can thrive together—with **clarity, ownership, and mutual respect** at the center.

---

### 🔹 My Approach as a Leader:

1. **Trust First**
   I intend to build trust through action. I will listen, understand blockers, and help where needed—not micromanage.

2. **Empower Ownership**
   I believe in involving team members in decisions. Solutions co-created are solutions owned. I will encourage everyone to think, speak, and lead where possible.

3. **Safe and Honest Communication**
   Psychological safety is a priority. I want this to be a space where anyone can raise an issue, share feedback, or admit mistakes—without fear.

4. **Recognition and Growth**
   Small wins matter. I will make sure we celebrate effort, not just outcomes, and align tasks with personal growth where possible.

5. **Balance and Accountability**
   I aim to maintain a balance—protecting team bandwidth while being outcome-driven. We'll set clear goals and follow through with mutual accountability.

---

### 🔹 Specific Practices I Plan to Implement:

* Weekly 1:1s to discuss blockers, aspirations, and feedback
* Quick daily stand-ups with individual clarity, not just status updates
* Public appreciation via \[Slack/Email/Team Meet]
* Task ownership via collaborative planning
* Optional “quiet focus” slots to reduce context switching
* Gentle deadline commitment practice: "What can you confidently commit to?"

### ✅ Request for Your Feedback & Approval

This is my initial plan based on what I’ve observed and what I believe will help us deliver better while keeping the team motivated.

I would love to hear your suggestions or additions to this model and am open to adapting based on your guidance.

Thank you for trusting me with this responsibility.

Warm regards,
**Shripad Hendre**
Team Lead – \[Your Team Name]

Would you like me to help personalize this for a specific team (e.g., engineering, ops, dev support), or convert it to a **presentation or Notion doc** for sharing visually?
